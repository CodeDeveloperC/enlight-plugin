# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the project!

The idea is to make this plugin grow with time.

## Issues

All bugs and new features or any research that needs to be done is tracked via Github Issues.

Check them regularly and if you see any of them you'd like to work on please leave a comment and just start working.

If you discovered bugs or have new ideas or feature requests, create a new issue and assign the right labels to it.
